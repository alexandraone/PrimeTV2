/*********************************************************************/

The utility of this program is to draw reconciled trees and it is well explained in :

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/148

The program can be run using an User Interface(experimental) or the console/script version.

Either way the input will be a species tree and a gene tree. If the gene tree is reconciled already
a map file won't be needed whereas if the tree is not reconciled the option "Reconcile" will have to 
be activated and a map file(gene to species nodes) will have to be given, the program will reconcile it by itself.

The list of parameters and their functions can be seen running the script or including --help, /? ect..
A list of parameters will be automatically loaded if they are included in the file config.cfg

To launch the User Interface the option --gui must be added.

The UI also allows to save and load configuration, save the tree in a file (different formats), print the tree
show/hide the parameters panel, modify the parameters in "in vivo", and load the trees to generate the drawing (generate tree 
button).

There are some compatibility issues with Qt4 and x11 that affects the user interface.
This issues will be solved as soon as Qt releases Qt5.
