/*********************************************************************/

The utility of this program is to draw reconciled trees and it is well explained in the paper.

the program can be run using an User Interface or the console/script version.

Either way the input will be a species tree and the gene tree. If the tree is reconciled already
a map file won't be needed where as if the tree is not reconciled the option "Reoncile" will have to 
be activated and a map file will have to be given, the program will reconcile it by itself.

The list of parameters and their functions can be seen running the script or including --help, /? ect..
A list of parameters will be automatically loaded if they are included in the file config.cfg

To launch User Interface the option --gui must be added.

The UI also allows to save and load configuration, save the tree in a file (different formats), print the tree
show/hide the parameters panel, modify the parameters in live, and load the trees to generate the drawing (generate tree 
button)
