The program has only been tested in UBUNTU.

It's compiled using CMAKE.

The list of packages needed to compile it are :

	BISON
	FLEX
	[QT4 X11] "optional"
	Cairo >= 1.0
	BOOST >=1.42

They can be installed in Ubuntu by using the following commands :

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-program-options-dev libcairo2-dev bison flex [libqt4-dev]

They can be installed in Fedora by using the following commands :

sudo yum install cairo-devel boost-devel cmake-devel

They can be installed in MAC by using the following commands :

sudo port install cmake
sudo port install cairo
sudo port install boost
sudo port install bison
sudo port install flex

As well as the C++ compiler and developer essentials.

The exec file "primetv" will be placed in usr/bin

NOTE : there is a incompatibility error with the latest Ubuntu version (12.04) and qt4-x11 which might make the User Interface to be instable.
